# hello-world
Introductory Github repository project.

"This is the beginning of a slow but sure learning-to-code process. I can commit to moving at the same pace as my daughter, doing the homework & revision for 30 to 40 min a day. Doing coding work for the equivalent amount of time she does her homework until she reaches matric will mean I will be at a totally different coding level in 7 to 11 years. That is a really optimistic & doable way of looking at this!'
